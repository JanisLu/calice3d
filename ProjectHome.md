Calice3D is a skeletal based 3D character animation library written in C++ in a platform-/graphic API-independent way. It's a stand-alone library which can be used in many different kinds of projects.
Based on Cal3D from version 0.7

Here are the priorities of this project:
  1. Keep the well documented and organized architecture found in Cal3D 0.7
  1. Performance (SSE, VMX, OpenCL, DirectXCompute, SPU implementations) and memory optimization)
  1. Vertices and faces optimised for last-generations GPU card
  1. Authoring tools
  1. Cool features (IK, clothes, object destruction, C# wrapper, ...)
